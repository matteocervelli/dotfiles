## Key Principles for Dotfiles Repository Design

### 1. Repository Structure
- Organize configuration files by purpose (e.g., separate files for aliases, functions, environment variables)
- Store dotfiles in a dedicated directory (e.g., `~/.dotfiles`)
- Use version control (preferably Git) for tracking changes

### 2. Installation Approach
- Create a symlink strategy to connect dotfiles from repository to home directory
- Develop an installation script to automate:
  - Symlinking configuration files
  - Installing system packages
  - Configuring system preferences

### 3. Recommended Components
- `.bash_profile` for shell startup configuration
- `.inputrc` for input line editing behaviors
- `.alias` for command shortcuts
- `.functions` for complex command definitions
- `.env` for environment variable settings
- `.gitconfig` for version control preferences

### 4. Automation Best Practices
- Use package managers like Homebrew for system tool installation
- Create scripts to set system defaults
- Design installation scripts to be idempotent (safely re-runnable)

### 5. Guiding Philosophy
> "You're the king of your castle!"

**Key Recommendation**: Automate system setup to enable rapid, consistent environment reconstruction across machines.

## üìö Educational Philosophy

### Why This Approach Works

**Five Layers of Protection:**

1. **Layer 1: User Account Restrictions**
   - Your child CANNOT install software
   - No access to system settings
   - No sudo/administrator privileges
   - File access limited to their home directory

2. **Layer 2: Parental Controls (Malcontent)**
   - System-level app restrictions
   - Time-based access control
   - Age-appropriate content filtering (OARS ratings)
   - Centrally managed via malcontent-control GUI

3. **Layer 3: Network DNS Filtering**
   - Blocks inappropriate websites at network level
   - Works across all apps (browser, chat, etc.)
   - Cannot be bypassed by kids
   - OpenDNS FamilyShield or Cloudflare for Families

4. **Layer 4: Browser Safety**
   - Firefox extensions (uBlock Origin, LeechBlock)
   - Kid-friendly homepage (PBS Kids)
   - Private browsing disabled
   - Strict tracking protection

5. **Layer 5: Physical Supervision**
   - Your presence and guidance
   - Teaching digital citizenship
   - Reviewing activities together
   - Building trust through transparency

### Screen Time Best Practices

**Recommended Daily Limits by Age:**
- Ages 4-6: 1-2 hours (supervised)
- Ages 6-8: 2-3 hours (supervised initially, gradual independence)
- Ages 8-10: 2-4 hours (check-ins, increasing independence)
- Ages 10-12: 3-5 hours (responsible independence, monitoring)

**Balance is Key:**
- Mix educational content (70%) with creative/fun time (30%)
- Encourage outdoor play and physical activity
- No screens 1 hour before bedtime
- Family device-free times (meals, etc.)

**Ages 6-8:**
- "Internet can be helpful and fun, but has dangers"
- "Never share personal information (name, address, school)"
- "If someone asks where you live, tell parent right away"

**Ages 8-10:**
- "Not everyone online is who they say they are"
- "It's okay to say no to uncomfortable requests"
- "Screenshots last forever - think before posting"

**Ages 10-12:**
- "Digital footprint is permanent"
- "Cyberbullying is real - be kind online"

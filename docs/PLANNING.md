## üìù Template Usage Instructions

### How to Use This Template

1. **Replace all bracketed placeholders** with project-specific information
2. **Customize sections** based on project type and complexity
3. **Add or remove use cases** as needed for your specific project
4. **Adjust timeline estimates** based on team size and complexity
5. **Modify technical assumptions** to match your technology stack
6. **Update security considerations** based on your compliance requirements

### Template Sections Explanation

- **Goals & Objectives**: Define what success looks like
- **Background & Context**: Establish current state and desired future state
- **Core Use Cases**: Document primary user interactions and expected outcomes
- **Technical Assumptions**: Document technology choices and constraints

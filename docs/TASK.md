## üìù Template Usage Instructions

### How to Use This Template

1. **Replace bracketed placeholders** with your specific project components and tasks
2. **Customize component names** to match your project architecture
3. **Adjust task granularity** based on team size and project complexity
4. **Modify timeline estimates** according to your development capacity
5. **Add or remove sections** based on project requirements
6. **Update prioritization** to match your project's critical path

### Task Writing Guidelines

- **Be Specific**: Each task should have a clear, measurable deliverable
- **Include Acceptance Criteria**: What defines "done" for each task
- **Consider Dependencies**: Order tasks based on technical dependencies
- **Estimate Effort**: Include time estimates for planning purposes
- **Assign Ownership**: Identify who is responsible for each task

### Customization by Project Type

#### For Web Applications
- Emphasize frontend/backend separation
- Include UI/UX design tasks
- Add deployment and DevOps tasks
- Include testing and QA processes

#### For Data Projects
- Focus on data pipeline tasks
- Include data quality and validation
- Add model training and evaluation
- Include data governance tasks

#### For API Projects
- Emphasize endpoint design and documentation
- Include authentication and authorization
- Add rate limiting and monitoring
- Include SDK and client library development

#### For Mobile Applications
- Include platform-specific tasks (iOS/Android)
- Add app store submission processes
- Include device testing and compatibility
- Add push notification systems

### Task Status Tracking

- **Not Started**: [ ] Task description
- **In Progress**: [üîÑ] Task description
- **Completed**: [‚úÖ] Task description
- **Blocked**: [üö´] Task description
- **Deferred**: [‚è∏Ô∏è] Task description

### Dependencies and Relationships

Use these markers to indicate task relationships:
- **Prerequisite**: ‚¨ÖÔ∏è Must complete before starting
- **Parallel**: ‚ÜîÔ∏è Can work on simultaneously
- **Follow-up**: ‚û°Ô∏è Should start after completion
- **Optional**: ‚ùì Nice to have but not critical

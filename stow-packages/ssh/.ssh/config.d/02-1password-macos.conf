# 1Password SSH Agent Configuration (macOS)
# Managed by: ~/dev/projects/dotfiles/stow-packages/ssh
#
# This file configures 1Password SSH agent on macOS.
# For Linux systems, use 02-1password-linux.conf instead.
#
# IMPORTANT: IdentitiesOnly prevents SSH from auto-loading ~/.ssh/id_* files
# which are 1Password references and cause errors during shell init.

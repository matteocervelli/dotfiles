# SSH Configuration
# Managed by: ~/dev/projects/dotfiles/stow-packages/ssh
#
# This is a modular SSH configuration that includes separate config files
# from ~/.ssh/config.d/ for better organization and maintainability.
#

#   02-1password-macos.conf   - 1Password agent (macOS only)
#   02-1password-linux.conf   - 1Password agent (Linux only)
#   10-github.conf            - GitHub SSH configuration
#   20-tailscale.conf         - Tailscale network hosts
#   30-vps.conf               - VPS servers (production/staging)
#   40-work.conf              - Work/client servers (not tracked in git)
#   90-custom.conf            - Machine-specific custom hosts (not tracked in git)

# Create socket directory for ControlMaster
# Run: mkdir -p ~/.ssh/sockets

# Include all configuration files from config.d/
# Files are processed in alphabetical order (01, 02, 10, 20, 90)
